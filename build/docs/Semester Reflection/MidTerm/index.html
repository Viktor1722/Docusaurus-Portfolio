during an event called the MidTerm review. This involved giving a brief presentation and then answering questions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Requirements" title="Direct link to Requirements">​</a></h2>
<p>The presentation needed to cover key discoveries from the first part of the internship and couldn&#x27;t be longer than 5 minutes, also I could choose to show a quick example of my portfolio&#x27;s layout.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="approach">Approach<a href="#approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Approach" title="Direct link to Approach">​</a></h2>
<p>While preparing my presentation, my primary goal was to clearly explain to the audience how I approached my tasks and what outcomes I achieved in the initial phase of my internship. I aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of my methods, detailing the strategies I employed and how they contributed to the progress of my project. Moreover, I intended to highlight the key results and learnings from this period, reflecting on how these experiences have enhanced my skills and understanding of the field. This was an opportunity not only to showcase my achievements but also to offer insights into the challenges I faced and how I overcame them, thereby giving a holistic view of my journey during the first half of my internship.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="research">Research<a href="#research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Research" title="Direct link to Research">​</a></h3>
<p>The research component is a vital aspect of this project, and choosing the right approach was key to the success of the internship. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve put extra effort into explaining my methodology and the significant discoveries I&#x27;ve made. In doing so, I aimed to demonstrate not only the thoroughness of my approach but also how my choice of model and techniques directly impacted the project&#x27;s effectiveness. This part of my work highlighted the importance of careful analysis and strategic decision-making in AI-based projects. My focus has been on ensuring that each step, from model selection to implementation, aligns with the project&#x27;s objectives, thereby maximizing the chances of a successful outcome. This approach reflected a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in AI research and underscores the significance of meticulous planning and execution in such endeavors.</p>

<p>This section was equally crucial as it demonstrated how the valuable information obtained from the research was incorporated into the final product. It highlighted the direct link between the theoretical research and practical application, showing that the findings were not just academic but had real-world implications in the development of the project. This integration of research into the final outcome is essential in illustrating the effectiveness of my approach. It underscores the practicality and relevance of the research, proving that the insights gained were not only insightful but also instrumental in shaping the final product. This part of my presentation aimed to emphasize the seamless transition from research to application, showcasing how theoretical concepts were transformed into tangible results, thus validating the importance of this research in the successful completion of the project.</p>

<p>After completing my presentation, my second evaluator showed a lot of interest in the AI model I had chosen for the voice-over generation task. He questioned whether I was confident in my selection and if I had conducted thorough research by pointing out that google also has a good array of same kind of models. I reassured him that I had done my research and i was confident that this AI model of choice was the best among all the major text-to-speech models available in the market since i have done a detailed research and testing.</p>

<p>In addition to the midterm review, there was a document that my company, mentor was required to complete. This document was meant to provide the teachers with further insights into my progress at the company. <strong>(Professional duties)</strong> During most of our meetings, my mentor expressed satisfaction with my performance during the first half of my internship. He mentioned that I displayed enthusiasm and motivation to learn. He also noted that I had a good understanding of the product I was working on and actively participating in refining its features to make them future-proof.</p>
<p>However, there were some areas where I needed improvement, particularly in my coding skills. Initially, my mentor believed that my coding skills were not up to par with my level of education since there were some remarks regarding the quality of my work on the voice-over generator.More specifically issues with the code structure and styling discrepancies. However after a brief discussion with my mentor, it became clear that my struggles were mainly linked to my unfamiliarity of using Material UI, which is Cape&#x27;s primary component library. I didn&#x27;t fully utilize its capabilities when coding the voice-over generator and didn&#x27;t properly implement the grid system in the popover menu.</p>
<p>Regarding the practical application of my knowledge <strong>(Situational Awareness)</strong>, my mentor was satisfied with my approach. Throughout our meetings, especially when discussing potential enhancements for the Voice-over generator, I consistently demonstrated effective communication with all of the developers of the Ai dev team by asking questions that clarified the project&#x27;s scope. My mentor noted that my method for tackling new problems or tasks was professional, aligning with Cape&#x27;s established working methods.</p>
<p>When it came to <strong>(Future-Oriented Organization)</strong> my mentor was pleased with my work during my research phase of research and choosing a suitable Ai model and learning Cape&#x27;s code base i was constantly communicating with him about my decisions, he was pleased that i was considering the cost of running such kind of Ai model and the developer experience and most importantly the quality of the audio and also that i was considering the users need and for what the Voice-over tool is going to be used, which played a crucial role in my research. Futhermore the awareness that this feature is going to be used for ad campaigns played a big role in the testing of the feature since me and my colleagues where trying to mimic as close as possible a real life situation that this tools is going to be used when active, like prompting existing scripts from companies that Cape is working with such as TakeAway and BasicFit. All that effort from my side was greatly appreciated from my mentor.</p>
<p>About the <strong>(Investigative problem solving)</strong> and <strong>(Targeted interactions)</strong>, my mentor said I understood the project well, including its purpose and how it could affect the Campaign Designer platform. But, he wasn&#x27;t happy with how I dealt with problems during development. Instead of asking other developers for help with issues I faced, I often tried to fix them alone. This sometimes led to using their packages and coding methods wrongly. My mentor&#x27;s main comment was that I didn&#x27;t talk enough with him or our teammates when I ran into coding problems which was the main cause of the my problems with the Cape&#x27;s coding packages and wrong use of components.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reflection">Reflection<a href="#reflection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reflection" title="Direct link to Reflection">​</a></h2>
<p>During the first half of the internship my work with the company, I demonstrated a blend of strengths and areas for improvement that shaped my overall performance.</p>
<p>My understanding of the projects was a strong point, as recognized by my mentor. In the phase of selecting an AI model, I displayed a comprehensive grasp of the project&#x27;s objectives, its potential impact on the Campaign Designer platform, and the crucial aspects of AI model selection. This included considering cost efficiency, development experience, audio quality of the model, and aligning the tool&#x27;s capabilities with user needs, particularly for generating audio in ad campaigns.</p>
<p>However, my approach to problem-solving during development showed room for growth. My mentor observed that while I had a good grasp of the project&#x27;s purpose, I tended to handle issues independently rather than seeking assistance or consulting with other developers.
