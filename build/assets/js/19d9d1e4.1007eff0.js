This decision was influenced by the previous time I used a template, which helped me understand the assignment and the goals I had to meet for the internship, so I decided to use it again for this project. I was able to comprehend that by responding to the template's questions once more and understand that the  ultimate research goal was to simplify generating voice-over scripts using AI, making it accessible and efficient, especially for those lacking audio recording resources. This was framed as creating a user-friendly interface for rapidly producing tailored, high-quality voice-over scripts. The solution involved integrating an AI-driven, fine-tunable text-to-speech model with an intuitive user interface, aiming for accessibility without requiring advanced technical skills and handling high-volume requests cost-effectively."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"more-information",children:(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/Research%20Report/2nd%20Research%20Phase/Research%20framing",children:"More information"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:""}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"Template",src:n(4793).Z+"",width:"1844",height:"2436"})})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},4793:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/researchTemplateVocieOver-3ed5d6a651f6da89097a7d5245e32277.png"},1151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o,a:()=>r});var i=n(7294);const s={},a=i.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
