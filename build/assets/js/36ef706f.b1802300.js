This platform facilitates ad creation by allowing users to upload a product image and select from pre-designed templates, to which they can then add text to create an advertisement. The task presented to me was to explore ways to automate this process, enhancing the platform's capability to generate personalized templates tailored to the specific needs and preferences of users for their individual ad creations.Moreover this assignment was part of Cape's migration to more automated platforms by using AI. This automation would not only streamline the ad-making process but also deliver a level of customization that could significantly elevate the user experience and efficiency of ad production but also will guarantee that the platform will be future-proof through the years."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"goal",children:"Goal"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The objective of this project was to delve into research and identify innovative methods to automate the creation of tailored and personalized templates and backgrounds for users, leveraging advanced AI technology.

By doing so, the project intended to transform the traditional, often time-consuming process of template creation into a more dynamic, user-centric experience. This automation seeks to enhance user experience by providing a seamless and efficient solution for individualized template creation, thereby reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.
