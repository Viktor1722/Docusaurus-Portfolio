This platform facilitates ad creation by allowing users to upload a product image and select from pre-designed templates, to which they can then add text to create an advertisement. The task presented to me was to explore ways to automate this process, enhancing the platform's capability to generate personalized templates tailored to the specific needs and preferences of users for their individual ad creations.
