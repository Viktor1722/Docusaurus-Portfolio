This meant I needed to train the model to make certain types of pictures in my case templates for ads. I spent two weeks research different models to see which one fits the need of the clients of the tool. I used methods like Competitive analysis and A/B Testing to pick the right one for the Template Designer. During the A/B Testing, I had to try out Stable diffusion and Dall-e2 which based on the conducted Comparison chart turned to be the best text-to-image models in my own tests. I checked if they are easyly implementable in the Cape's code base, if its easy ot generate images fast and how hard is to train them. I found out it was hard to train them to do a very specific job. I tried using the most popular program for such kind of tasks popular PyTorch, but it was hard for me because the in order to train the model i had to use Python, a programming language I don't know well. Also, training a tool that makes visual images needs a lot of computer power. This was when I realized this task was too hard for me, also because training a tool for visual images needs a lot of computer power, which neither my computer nor Cape's had at the time.
