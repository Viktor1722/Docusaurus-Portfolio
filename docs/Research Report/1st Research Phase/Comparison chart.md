## Introduction

This research method offers a thorough examination of the industry for AI image generation, with a particular emphasis on major rivals that provide text-to-image services. My research reveals a range of advantages and disadvantages for each of these platforms, pointing me areas where my product can be improved and innovated.

## Why did i changed the research method
As evident, I've concluded the need to modify my research methodology, as it wasn't aligning with my research objectives and the task at hand. Given that the competitor analysis essentially involves contrasting different tools and businesses, it doesn't quite fit within my project's framework in my opinion. Therefore, retaining this analysis in my documentation seems unnecessary, primarily because my focus was on creating a singular feature within a fully functional tool serving a distinct purpose. By incorporating this AI model comparison, I'm merely exploring their image generation capabilities for my project, rather than comparing the Template generator against simmilar tools. My organization's aim was to find an appropriate AI model solely for template creation. Hence, drawing parallels between this Template generator and similar market offerings wasn't a requirement from my end.

After deciding that this method is not the right one, I needed to pick a research method that matched what I wanted to achieve in my study. I decided to review all the CMD research methods again and pick one that fit my goal. I came across a comparison chart. In simple terms, this chart helps look at and compare features of different products or tools to find the best one for my project. Which in my opinion was the research methods that was algining the most with the objective of my research. 

## Market Overview and methodology

Its importance in advertising is expanding because these tools provide economical, effective, and adaptable means of producing a wide range of interesting and captivating materials.These kinds of solutions provide users with a variety of advantages, including quicker and more cost-effective image template production. 
Regarding the process, I have consulted a number of web sources and including product pages. 

## Why 

In order to address the two sub-research questions and find AI model that would meet the needs of my project, I choose this research approach. Using the approach to investigate this area of AI technology has been really helpful to my skills. It gave me the opportunity to not only learn more about different tools but also to use them directly in the environment. My perspective has been broadened even more by this experience, and now I have useful knowledge about how to use these kinds of technologies. Most importantly, it has helped me comprehend the qualities of an efficient Text-to-Image (TTI) AI model. It also provided me with a solid foundation on deciding which two AI models to utilize for the A/B testing where I compered side by side the two models that i liked the most from this competitive analysis.

## Conclusion

To sum up, carrying out this comparison chart has been a crucial component of my research and has greatly improved my comprehension of the state of AI text-to-image technology. I learned a lot about the essential components and specifications of an effective AI model for image production during this approach. Dall-e2 and Stable Diffusion stood up as being very noteworthy, with Dall-e slightly differentiating itself with its capacity to produce remarkably lifelike visuals through sophisticated AI architecture.Even though the image generation isn't always reliable, the variety and calibre of services it offers make up for it.Conversely, Stable Diffusion also made an impression on me because of its capacity to produce a wide variety of pictures, which makes it extremely adaptable to many content categories. Its appeal is increased by its easy-to-use interface. 
Even though some of the images don't match the prompt that I supplied, overall the experience was excellent, and the product's overall quality and affordability make it a serious competitor in the market for AI image generators. 

Regarding the other AI models I tried, I didn't think they were strong competitors. DeepDream and RunawayML were okay at generating images, but they couldn't match the performance and prompt understanding of Dall-e and Stable Diffusion. I found MidJourney to be the best, even better than the AI models I liked most. The image quality was consistently excellent, and with the right prompts, you could create amazing images. Sadly, because MidJourney doesn't have an API, I couldn't use it in my project, which was a letdown. The last two models in my study were the weakest, in my view. Artbreeder couldn't generate images from text, and the image quality wasn't very good. The image quality of DeepArt was also not that great but in contrast this model was able to generate images from text. With all this info, I was set to do A/B testing to choose the right model for my project.
