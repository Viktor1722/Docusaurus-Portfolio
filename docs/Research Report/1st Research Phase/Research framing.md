## Introduction and Why I choose this method
This study technique served as a creative framework, thoughtfully constructed with questions intended to direct my process of analysis. It motivated me to go farther into pinpointing the essential elements of my research, including main ideas, purposes, constraints, and overall aims. Through a methodical approach to these questions, I was improving the structure of my research and guaranteeing a thorough investigation of the subject. This methodical technique helped to keep the research focused and clear, allowing for a more in-depth and perceptive analysis that directly relates to the goals of my study.



### Sub-research questions 
What are the key considerations that have to be taken in mind while making the research?

### Activities 
**Team Communication:** I'll start by talking to the team members involved in AI integration. This includes developers, project managers, and anyone else working on the project.

**Research documents:** I'll use research documentation CMD research methods and research templates like this to give an answer to my questions 


## Findings 

This study technique served as a creative framework, thoughtfully constructed with questions intended to direct my process of analysis. It motivated me to go farther into pinpointing the essential elements of my research, including main ideas, purposes, constraints, and overall aims. Through a methodical approach to these questions, I was improving the structure of my research and guaranteeing a thorough investigation of the subject. This methodical technique helped to keep the research focused and clear, allowing for a more in-depth and perceptive analysis that directly relates to the goals of my study.

The structure of the template provided a solid framework for my investigation. Because of its structured format, I was able to see the issue from multiple angles and think about a wide range of impacting elements and research techniques that I can use to clarify my concerns later on in the research process. It provided a methodical approach of identifying and addressing the primary problems, making the intricacy of the task I had to complete more understandable.My ability to critically think was greatly enhanced by this approach, which made sure that I carefully considered all pertinent factors and elements.  

I eventually came to understand that my main goal was to make the integration of an AI model that could create visually beautiful templates as simple and easy as possible, especially for people who are not skilled in design and time. This problem resulted in the creation of an interface that could generate high-quality, personalized ad templates fast. The perfect solution would be affordable, able to manage a high volume of requests, and simple to use without requiring much technical understanding. My study led to the implementation of adaptive and user-friendly text-to-image models powered by AI. As a result, I narrowed down my design question to focus on developing an automated system that can produce a variety of unique, high-quality ad templates in a format that is simple to use.


## Conclusion
Using the framework in the first stage cleared the ground for a deliberate, well-informed approach to the issue. It went beyond simple comprehension, giving me the confidence to question assumptions and look into creative fixes. This method not only helped me feel more comfortable browsing the research, but it also had a big impact on our next plans, directing them in the direction of something more thoughtful and informed.
