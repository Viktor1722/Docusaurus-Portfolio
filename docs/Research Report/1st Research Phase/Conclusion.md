The research proved extremely valuable, as it helped me understand the task assigned by Cape thanks to CMD research methods. By framing the research, I gained a deeper insight into the assignment's underlying concept and what was expected as the final deliverable. The customer journey map was particularly useful. It allowed me to view the template generator from the user's perspective, understanding their needs and experiences.

Additionally, creating personas was vital for grasping the varied requirements in advertising and social media marketing. These personas shed light on how the feature could enhance visual content creation for ads and social media. The competitive analysis I conducted played a key role in selecting the right AI model for the assignment. This process broadened my knowledge about different tools and their practical applications.

A significant part of my research involved A/B testing. I chose Dall-e and Stable Diffusion, two top AI models from the competitive analysis, and put them through rigorous tests. These tests included generating complex images and assessing the models' creativity, responsiveness to prompts, and the style of the images they produced.

## Why did i change my assignment 
During a meeting with my mentor, it was suggested that the AI model should also be trained to generate only templates. Given my familiarity with Pytorch, a popular AI model training tool, I began experimenting with training both Dall-e and Stable Diffusion. However, challenges arose due to my limited experience with Python, the programming language used for training AI models, and my and Cape's computer's insufficient graphical capabilities to handle extensive image processing and rendering. This realization marked a pivotal moment in the project, as I recognized the difficulty of training AI models with my current skill set and equipment limitations.

## How i changed the assignment 
After realizing the assignment was beyond my capabilities, I decided to discuss it with my mentor. I arranged a meeting in the next few days to talk about my discoveries and the necessary steps ahead. My mentor understood my situation well and appreciated my openness and honesty about my conclusions. He also arraigned a meeting to talk with other developers working on the platform, who agreed that the task was quite challenging.

Subsequently, my mentor was given the responsibility to find a new project for me. After a few days, he introduced me to their main product, the Campaign Designer, and my new role was to develop new features, including integrating AI models. This was aimed at enhancing user experience and automating tasks that used to be done manually.

My first assignment in this new role involved integrating a text-to-speech AI model. This model would be responsible for creating voiceover audio files for marketing campaigns.
