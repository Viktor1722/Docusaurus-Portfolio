During my first four weeks of being an Intern at Cape, my primary focus has been conducting research on various topics. In the initial week, I began by delving into Cape's documentation to gain a deeper understanding of their workflow and the tools they employ to accomplish their objectives. This documentation provided me with a valuable introduction to the company and significantly facilitated my adaptation process.

## Problem /  Opportunity 

In the early meeting with my mentor and the AI development team, I was introduced to one of Cape's innovative platforms, the Template Designer. This platform facilitates ad creation by allowing users to upload a product image and select from pre-designed templates, to which they can then add text to create an advertisement. The task presented to me was to explore ways to automate this process, enhancing the platform's capability to generate personalized templates tailored to the specific needs and preferences of users for their individual ad creations.Moreover this assignment was part of Cape's migration to more automated platforms by using AI. This automation would not only streamline the ad-making process but also deliver a level of customization that could significantly elevate the user experience and efficiency of ad production but also will guarantee that the platform will be future-proof through the years.

## Goal 

The objective of this project was to delve into research and identify innovative methods to automate the creation of tailored and personalized templates and backgrounds for users, leveraging advanced AI technology. The central aim was to streamline the design process, empowering the AI to generate designs that are not only aesthetically fitting but also uniquely catered to each user's specific requirements and preferences. By doing so, the project intended to transform the traditional, often time-consuming process of template creation into a more dynamic, user-centric experience. This automation seeks to enhance user experience by providing a seamless and efficient solution for individualized template creation, thereby reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. The project envisioned a system where users could input their preferences, and the AI would interpret these inputs to create visually appealing and contextually relevant designs, potentially revolutionizing the way visual content is created and customized in various industries.

## Approach 

My strategy involved leveraging the CMD research methods and the DOT framework, which are pivotal in providing insights into the research questions outlined in the project plan. Initially, I'll commence by completing a Research form filled with thoughtfully crafted questions. These questions are designed to prompt deep consideration from my side to consider various aspects, including potential challenges and critical points I might encounter during the research. This template was also instrumental in enhancing my understanding of the assignment's subject.

Subsequently, I will develop personas to pinpoint the target audience. These personas are essential not only in comprehending who will use the tool and how to design the user interface effectively but also in gauging the potential impact of the Template Designer on the industry.

Following that, I'll proceed with a Customer Journey Map to outline the steps users would typically go through before and after encountering the tool. This map will not only trace the user's path but also illuminate key areas that require more of my focus and attention during the development process.

Next, I'll conduct a competitor analysis to understand the landscape of suitable text-to-image AI models. This phase will involve thoroughly reviewing articles, product pages, and personally experimenting with the AI models to assess their quality visually.

In the final stage, the two AI models that most closely align with my project requirements will undergo an intensive evaluation through A/B testing. This comparative analysis will be crucial in determining which AI model is best suited for integration into the Campaign Designer.
