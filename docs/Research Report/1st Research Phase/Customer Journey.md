## Introduction

This research methodology carefully describes the steps a user takes to investigate the market for tools for creating advertisements templates. It clarifies the several phases people go through, from first awareness and deliberation to the ultimate decision-making procedure. This method not only documents the user's experience selecting the appropriate tool, but it also identifies the variables that shaped their decisions. I wanted to get a thorough grasp of user preferences, problems, and reasons for choosing AI technologies, so I mapped out these processes. This will help me with my research approach.

## Why 
I purposefully chose this research method in order to gain a deeper understanding of the perspectives and expectations of users when they interact with the tool. One of the main components of this strategy was answering sub-questions, like evaluating Template Designer's possible influence on the market.

### Sub research questions 
What impact Template Designer is going to have on the industry?

### Activities 
<p><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong> Conduct an in-depth analysis of the current state of the industry, identifying trends and challenges. This will provide insights into how the Campaign Designer can address industry needs.</p>

<strong>Competitor Evaluation:</strong> Evaluate competitors and similar products in the market to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This analysis will help anticipate how the Template Designer can stand out and make a positive impact in the industry.

## Findings
With the help of this customer journey mapping, users' interactions with the tool were visually stated, offering insights into their potential actions and thoughts at each turn. I learned plenty from this journey, and it was really valuable. It became evident that users would be immensely grateful for the ability to use AI to create templates for their marketing campaigns, greatly increasing their productivity. This implies a change in emphasis from the laborious process of designing templates to the essential elements of creating a marketing campaign plan. The template designer tool is especially helpful for freelancers who prioritise efficiency in campaign development, as it promises to save costs in addition to time.


The map demonstrated how much users want tools that make their professional work easier. Their real interest is in planning and executing marketing strategies, so being able to move swiftly through the template creation and ad development processes frees up more time and energy. People are looking for an easy-to-use method that does away with the complications of intricate design work, which will lessen frustration and foster greater creativity. Campaign concepts that are more imaginative and powerful may arise from this move away from the specifics of design and towards a more comprehensive focus on marketing strategy.



## Conclusion

Analysing the user's steps similarly gave us a clear picture of the areas in which our product could succeed and set itself apart. Not only did this methodical approach help us answer these sub-questions, but it also helped us match our product development to the needs and expectations of the real world. By emphasising these features, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what people look for in these kinds of tools and make sure that our product is both competitive and genuinely appealing to our intended market.
