## Introduction and Why I choose this method
This research method functions as a thought-provoking template, carefully crafted with questions designed to guide my analytical process. It encouraged me to delve deeper into identifying the critical aspects of my research, such as key points, objectives, limitations, and overarching goals. By systematically addressing these queries, I not only structured my research more effectively but also ensured a comprehensive exploration of the topic. This structured approach went to maintaining my focus and clarity throughout the research, enabling a more thorough and insightful analysis that aligns closely with the intended outcomes of my study.


### Sub-research questions 
What are the key considerations that have to be taken in mind while making the research?

### Activities 
**Team Communication.** I'll start by talking to the team members involved in AI integration. This includes developers, project managers, and anyone else working on the project.


## Findings 

The template served as a robust structure for my research. Its structured nature provided a multi-dimensional view of the problem, prompting me to examine various perspectives and consider a wide range of influencing factors and research methods that i can use further in the research phase to make my questions clear. It offered a systematic way to pinpoint and tackle the main issues, thereby clarifying the complexity of the challenge I faced.This process was vital for developing my critical thinking skills, ensuring that I comprehensively evaluated all relevant aspects and variables. 

I discovered that my goal in the end of the research was to simplify the process of generating a voice over script using Ai, making it accessible and efficient, particularly for those without audio recording resources. I've framed this challenge as creating an interface for rapidly producing high-quality, tailored voice over scripts. The ideal solution should be user-friendly, not requiring advanced technical skills, and cost-effective while handling high-volume requests. My findings lead me to the solution of incorporating an AI-driven text-to-speech model, which is also fine-tunable model, and an intuitive user interface.

## Conclusion
The template's application in the initial phase paved the way for a methodical, informed approach to the problem. It transcended mere understanding, empowering me to challenge preconceived notions and investigate innovative solutions. This approach not only bolstered my confidence in navigating the research but also significantly influenced my subsequent strategies, steering them towards a more deliberate and knowledge-driven path.
