## Introduction and Why I choose this method
This research method functions as a thought-provoking template, carefully crafted with questions designed to guide my analytical process. It encourages me to delve deeper into identifying the critical aspects of my research, such as key points, objectives, limitations, and overarching goals. By systematically addressing these queries, I am not only structuring my research more effectively but also ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the topic. This structured approach aids in maintaining focus and clarity throughout the research, enabling a more thorough and insightful analysis that aligns closely with the intended outcomes of my study.


### Sub-research questions 
What are the key considerations that have to be taken in mind while making the research?

### Activities 
<p><strong>Team Communication:</strong> I'll start by talking to the team members involved in AI integration. This includes developers, project managers, and anyone else working on the project.</p>


## Findings 

In the initial stages of my research, I made the decision to employ the CMD research methodology, starting with the Research framing.This decision was influenced by the comprehensive nature of the Research framing template, which was an effective method for framing the objectives, challenges, and critical factors at the start of my investigation. This foundational step was crucial as it laid out a clear roadmap for the entire research and development phase. By methodically addressing specific questions, I was able to gain a broad understanding of the direction I needed to pursue and the necessary actions to undertake.

The template served as a robust structure for my research. Its structured nature provided a multi-dimensional view of the problem, prompting me to examine various perspectives and consider a wide range of influencing factors and research methods that i can use furtehr in the research phase to make my questions clear. It offered a systematic way to pinpoint and tackle the main issues, thereby clarifying the complexity of the challenge I faced.This process was vital for developing my critical thinking skills, ensuring that I comprehensively evaluated all relevant aspects and variables. 

I conducted that my goal in the end of the research was to simplify this process of generating a voice over script, making it accessible and efficient, particularly for those without audio recording resources. I've framed this challenge as creating an interface for rapidly producing high-quality, tailored voice over scripts. The ideal solution should be user-friendly, not requiring advanced technical skills, and cost-effective while handling high-volume requests. My research suggests solutions like an AI-driven text-to-speech model, which is also fine-tunable model, and an intuitive user interface. This has led me to refine my design question to focus on automating the generation of custom, high-quality, and diverse voice overs in a user-friendly manner.


## Conclusion
The template's application in the initial phase paved the way for a methodical, informed approach to the problem. It transcended mere understanding, empowering me to challenge preconceived notions and investigate innovative solutions. This approach not only bolstered my confidence in navigating the research but also significantly influenced our subsequent strategies, steering them towards a more deliberate and knowledge-driven path.
