## Introduction

This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the current AI voiceover market, focusing on key competitors offering text-to-speech services for advertising campaigns. My findings reveal varied strengths and weaknesses across these platforms, highlighting opportunities for innovation and improvement for my project.

## Market Overview and methodology 
The AI voiceover market is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in text-to-speech and AI technologies. Its significance in advertising is growing, as these tools offer cost-effective, efficient, and versatile solutions for creating diverse and engaging content.These such kind of tools offers range of difference benefits to the users such as cost efficiency and also faster creation of voice over scripts. 
In terms of the methodology that i have used several online resources such as articles, product pages and relevance to advertising campaign production analyzing. 

## Why 
### Sub research questions
Are there similar products on the market?

Which AI models would be suitable for the needs of the Template Designer?
### Activities 
<p><strong>Research AI Models:</strong> Conduct research to identify AI models that align with the identified project requirements, considering factors like accuracy, scalability, and compatibility with the development environment.</p>

<p><strong>Market Research:</strong> Conduct thorough market research to identify competing products that offer similar functionalities or services to the Campaign Designer.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Analysis:</strong> Examine the latest feature updates or enhancements introduced by these competitors, focusing on understanding how they are evolving to meet user demands and market trends.</p>


I selected this research approach to identify AI models or tools that align with my project's requirements and answer these two sub-research questions. Exploring this segment of AI technology through this method has been incredibly enlightening. It not only allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of various tools but also to experiment with them firsthand. This experience has enriched my perspective, providing me with practical knowledge about the usage of such tools. Importantly, it has offered me a clearer understanding of the characteristics that define an effective Text-to-Speech (TTS) AI model, which is invaluable for my assignment. Furthermore it gave me a great base for coming to a conclusion which two Ai models are going to be used for the A/B testing where i compered side by side the two models that i liked the most from this competitive analysis.
