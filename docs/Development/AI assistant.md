## Problem / Opportunity 

After the development of the voice over generator was finished I had a quick meeting with mentor in order to discusss the next project in my internship. Subsequenlty i had to arrange a meetting with the Max one of the designers, since he was working on designing the new tool that i was about to work on. The porject that i was about to work on was to implement an LLM Ai model to their Campaign designer platform this model would be use to make a new feature that me and my mentor called it input filed assistant the purpose of this tool would be to be an assistant that would help the users in various aspects. Their idea was the this assistant will be put besides input and text fields and the functionality would be that the users would be able to generate text from it also he would be able to make it shorter or longer furthermore they were thinking that the user would be able to translate and check for grammar in the text
