### The assignment 


 #### The original version of the assignmnet 
 In today's context, there is a growing demand for rapidly creating advertisements. The internet offers significant opportunities for individuals and companies to promote their businesses through ads. However, some entrepreneurs and companies lack the necessary skills or time to design their own advertisements, and there is often a shortage of templates tailored to their specific marketing needs. Consequently, Cape's current objective is to introduce an AI tool capable of generating templates that align with their requirements. This initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and accelerate the process of advertising a company or service.

<p style={{ color: '#ed38d6' }}><b>In simpler terms, my role in this project involves working on the implementation of an AI system that will generate templates that are more precise and well-suited to the specific needs of each client.</b></p>

The main challenge I anticipate during this project lies in the successful implementation of the AI tool for generating customized advertising templates. Ensuring that the AI system accurately understands and interprets the specific requirements of each client is crucial. It will require fine-tuning and refining the AI's capabilities to generate templates that not only meet the client's needs but also align with their marketing goals. Additionally, there may be a need to address any potential issues related to the diversity of client requirements and the adaptability of the AI tool. My role will involve navigating these challenges, working to optimize the AI system's performance, and ensuring that it consistently delivers high-quality and tailored templates for our clients' marketing endeavors.

This project will offer many benefits one of which is to provide clients with an invaluable tool that simplifies and expedites the creation of tailored advertising templates, ultimately enhancing their marketing efforts. This will lead to improved efficiency and productivity in promoting their businesses or services. Furthermore, the project aligns with the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technology, ensuring that the platform remains cutting-edge and future-proof. It enhances Cape’s competitive edge and positions them as a one of the leaders in the industry. Lastly, the implementation of this AI tool can potentially expand client base by catering to entrepreneurs and businesses that previously lacked the resources or skills for effective ad design. Overall, the project's benefits encompass improved client satisfaction, technological advancement, and potential business growth.

#### The new version of the assignment 

At the start of the project, my job was to add a tool that turns text into images in Cape's Template Designer tool. This meant I needed to train the model to make certain types of pictures in my case templates for ads. I spent two weeks research different models to see which one fits the need of the clients of the tool. I used methods like Competitive analysis and A/B Testing to pick the right one for the Template Designer. During the A/B Testing, I had to try out Stable diffusion and Dall-e2 which based on the conducted Competitive analysis turned to be the best text-to-image models in my own tests. I checked if they are easyly implementable in the Cape's code base, if its easy ot generate images fast and how hard is to train them. I found out it was hard to train them to do a very specific job. I tried using the most popular program for such kind of tasks popular PyTorch, but it was hard for me because the in order to train the model i had to use Python, a programming language I don't know well. Also, training a tool that makes visual images needs a lot of computer power. This was when I realized this task was too hard for me, also because training a tool for visual images needs a lot of computer power, which neither my computer nor Cape's have. This experience tied back to my initial two weeks of research and showed why my first task was too hard.

After understanding that the task was too challenging for me, I decided to talk with my mentor about the next steps. Together, we sought advice from experienced developers at Cape, who agreed that the assignment was difficult. This resulted in my mentor assigning me a different task for the remainder of my internship.Which was to research and implementation of Ai models in different parts of their flagship platform the Campaign designer. This meant that i had to research and find a suitable Ai model. 

My new task at Cape was to work on an AI tool that creates voice-overs automatically. This project is important for the company because it helps meet one of Cape's main goals: making it easier for clients to create ads and automating more and more tasks in the Campaign Designer. By using this AI voice-over tool, clients can quickly make voice-overs for their campaigns without much effort. This makes the process faster and simpler, and the voice-overs are high quality and can be customized to fit the client's needs. Adding this tool will be a key part of Cape's plan to use more advanced AI and making their platform future prof. It's expected to make the services we offer for advertising and campaign management much better and more efficient. So, yes, developing this AI voice-over generator was a priority for the company as it directly supports thier broader strategy and goals for further expansion in to the future.
