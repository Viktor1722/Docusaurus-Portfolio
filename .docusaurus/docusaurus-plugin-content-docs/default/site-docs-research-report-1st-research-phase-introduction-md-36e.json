  "description": "During my first four weeks of being an Intern at Cape, my primary focus has been conducting research on various topics. In the initial week, I began by delving into Cape's documentation to gain a deeper understanding of their workflow and the tools they employ to accomplish their objectives. This documentation provided me with a valuable introduction to the company and significantly facilitated my adaptation process.",
