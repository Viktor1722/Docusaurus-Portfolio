  "description": "To get a real feel for how people would interact with the feature, I put together a Customer journey map. This was a visual story of a user's path of before and after finding the tool, showing me their potential actions and thoughts at each point in the process. The clues I gathered from this map were from a great interest. It turns out, users would really appreciate being able to whip up templates in no time it would give them a boost in productivity. This means they can focus more on the actual marketing campaigns rather than getting bogged down in design details.",
