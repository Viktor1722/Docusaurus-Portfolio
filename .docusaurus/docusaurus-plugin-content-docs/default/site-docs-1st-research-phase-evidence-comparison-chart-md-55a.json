  "description": "I have chosen this research approach to address the two sub-research questions and find an AI model that would work for the purpose of my project. My ability to research this field of AI technology has greatly benefited from using Competitive analysis method. I was able to get more knowledge about various tools and put them to immediate use in the setting. This experience has expanded my perspective even further, and I now know practical information about how to use these kinds of technologies. Above all, it has made it easier for me to understand what makes a Text-to-Image (TTI) AI model effective. It also gave me a strong basis for choosing which two AI models to use in the A/B testing.",
