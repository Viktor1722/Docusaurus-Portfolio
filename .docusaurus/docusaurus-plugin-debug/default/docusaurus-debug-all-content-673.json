My ability to research this field of AI technology has greatly benefited from using Competitive analysis method. I was able to get more knowledge about various tools and put them to immediate use in the setting. This experience has expanded my perspective even further, and I now know practical information about how to use these kinds of technologies. Above all, it has made it easier for me to understand what makes a Text-to-Image (TTI) AI model effective. It also gave me a strong basis for choosing which two AI models to use in the A/B testing.",

This foundational step was crucial as it laid out a clear roadmap for the entire research and development phase.
